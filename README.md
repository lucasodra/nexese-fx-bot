   - **QUANTUM_SERVICE_API:** API key for the quantum computing service.

4. **Run the Bot:**
   ```bash
   python trading_bot.py
   ```

## Usage

The bot can be used in various modes, including live trading, backtesting, and simulation:

### Live Trading
```bash
python trading_bot.py --mode live --symbol EURUSD
```

### Backtesting
```bash
python trading_bot.py --mode backtest --start 2023-01-01 --end 2023-12-31 --symbol EURUSD
```

### Simulation
```bash
python trading_bot.py --mode simulate --symbol EURUSD
```

## Quantum Techniques Applied

### Quantum Monte Carlo Simulations
Monte Carlo methods are enhanced using quantum algorithms to simulate the price paths of assets, incorporating stochastic processes. This technique improves the accuracy of predicting potential future prices and risks.

### Quantum Annealing
The bot uses quantum annealing to optimize the trading strategy parameters, finding the global optimum among a vast number of possible configurations. This ensures that the bot operates under the most favorable conditions for profitability.

### Quantum Machine Learning (QML)
QML models are implemented to analyze large datasets, providing deeper insights into market behaviors. These models are particularly effective in identifying non-linear patterns and correlations that traditional machine learning models might miss.

### Entanglement & Superposition
Quantum entanglement and superposition are used to manage multi-asset trading strategies, allowing the bot to capture the interdependencies between different assets. This results in a more cohesive and effective trading strategy.

## Algorithmic Strategy

The bot employs a sophisticated algorithm that combines traditional quantitative methods with quantum enhancements:

### Entry and Exit Strategy
- **Mean Reversion:** Buys assets when prices deviate significantly from their historical mean and sells when they revert.
- **Momentum Trading:** Capitalizes on the continuation of existing market trends.
- **Statistical Arbitrage:** Exploits price inefficiencies between related assets.

### Risk Management
- **Stop Loss:** Automatically exits trades when the market moves unfavorably.
- **Position Sizing:** Determines the size of each trade based on the bot's confidence level and risk appetite.

### Parameter Optimization
- **Quantum Annealing:** Continuously optimizes parameters such as the Take Profit Margin (TPM), Accepted Reversal Margin (ARM), and Bearish Entry Level (BEL).

    A[Start] --> B[Request Market Data]
    B --> C{Is Price > TP Alert?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Trigger Sell Order]
    C -->|No| E{Is Price < AE Alert?}
    E -->|Yes| F[Trigger Buy Order]
    E -->|No| G[Wait for next tick]
    D --> H[Close Position]
    F --> I[Open New Position]
    H --> A
    I --> A
```

## Advanced Features
